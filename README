nanosvgjs is a zero dependency JavaScript SVG parser based on a translation of
the NanoSVG C code.  It can be used without any browser infrastructure.

nanosvgjs is a partially automatic and partially manual port of NanoSVG to
JavaScript.  The original C source is:

https://github.com/memononen/nanosvg

Most of the code was translated directly/automatically from the C code, so
there are comments of the original C types, etc.  This makes the code feel a
little bit foreign, but this will be gradually improved over time.

The port is pretty close to complete, but some things are unfinished, for
example handling of gradients.  Currently works for fine for tiger.svg, etc.
